# Introduction

## Introduction

- With the rise in popularity of YouTube, many people are now making a living off creating YouTube videos.

- The more views gained by the video, the more likely it is for that channel to profit.

- We are interested in predicting the growth rate in video views between the **second** and **sixth** hour that a YouTube video is published.

# Pre-Processing

## Outliers

- Examined a univariate plot to look for stray points and removed them systematically.

  - Based off personal judgment and inference on the effect of the stray points.
 
- We also remove highly correlated variables as indicated by a heat map.

  - To avoid overfitting based on having too many predictors.
  
## Predictor Selection

- We use LASSO to select significant predictors.
  
  - Used to refine predictors from a large subset.
  
  - LASSO pushes non-significant predictors to zero and keeps the most significant ones.
  
- First fit a LASSO model for a sequence of candidate $\lambda$ values. 
 
- Then select our optimal value of $\lambda$ as the one that is one standard deviation above the $\lambda$ value that resulted in the lowest test MSE.

- Then extract the predicted coefficients in this LASSO model as our predictors for the candidate model.


# Candidate Models

## Bagging
